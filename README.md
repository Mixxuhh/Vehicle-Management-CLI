# Vehicle Management CLI

A TypeScript-based Command-Line Interface (CLI) application for managing and interacting with vehicles. Users can create, manage, and perform actions on different types of vehicles, including **Cars**, **Trucks**, and **Motorbikes**. The CLI provides functionality to tow vehicles, perform wheelies (for motorbikes), and explore various vehicle properties.

---

## Features

- Create and manage different types of vehicles:
  - **Car**: Create cars with properties like make, model, year, color, weight, and top speed.
  - **Truck**: Create trucks with additional towing capabilities.
  - **Motorbike**: Create motorbikes with wheelie functionality.
- Perform various actions on vehicles, such as:
  - Print vehicle details.
  - Start, stop, accelerate, decelerate, turn, or reverse a vehicle.
  - Tow a vehicle using a truck.
  - Perform a wheelie with a motorbike.
- Interactive CLI powered by **Inquirer.js** for seamless user experience.
- Ensures proper constraints like:
  - A truck cannot tow itself.
  - Trucks can only tow vehicles within their towing capacity.
- Clean TypeScript design using object-oriented principles:
  - Base `Vehicle` class with shared properties.
  - Extended classes for **Truck**, **Car**, and **Motorbike**.
  - Interfaces like `AbleToTow` for additional behavior.

---

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript**: For strong typing and robust object-oriented structure.
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment for executing the CLI.
- **Inquirer.js**: Interactive prompts for user input.
- **ES6 Modules**: Modular structure for better code organization.
